# Javascript and ES6+
Javascript is an implementation of ECMAScript. ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, added a whole lot of new features to the language that greatly improved on Javascript and alleviated some of its flaws. Later versions of the language added even more useful syntactic sugar.

All browsers support up to ES5 currently. To use features from ES6+, Babel must be used to transpile the code into ES5 syntax.

## ES6 
- New keywords `let` and `const` for block-scoped variables, as well as block-scoped functions
- Template strings for inserting variables into strings and making multiline strings
- Arrow functions, which are more concise and don't have their own `this`
- Class syntactic sugar for more intuitive OOP
- Destructuring for arrays and objects
- Enhanced object literals for prototyping
- New data structures `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`
- New primitive type `Symbol`
- Default parameters, rest parameters, and spread operator
- Promises
- Iterators and the `for...of` loop
- Generators
- Subclassable built-ins for `Array`, `Date`, and DOM elements
- New APIs for `Math`, `Number`, `String`, `Array`, and `Object`
- Binary and octal literals
- Modules and module loaders, `export` and `import`
- Proxies
- Reflect API
- Unicode
- Tail calls

## ES7
- The `Array.prototype.includes()` method
- Exponentiation operator

## ES8
- Async functions with `async` and `await` keywords
- Shared memory and atomics
- New methods and properties for `Object` and string padding
- Trailing commas in function parameters lists and calls

## ES9
- Asynchronous iteration using `Symbol`
- Rest/spread properties
- New regex features

## ES10
- New primitive type `BigInt`
- The `String.prototype.matchAll()` method
- Dynamic imports, allowing imports to be assigned to variables
- New methods for `Array`, `Object`, and `String`, and a `description` property for `Symbol`
- A stringify method for JSON
- Stable algorithm for `Array.prototype.sort()`
- A `toString()` method for functions
- Optional catch binding
- Standardized global object
- Hashbang grammar
- New syntax for classes using the `#`
