# Asynchronous Programming
In a typical program, each line is executed one-by-one, so a function has to entirely finish before the next block can be executed. This can immensely slow down a webpage, especially in situations where the UI gets stuck loading because it is waiting for a task to finish executing. By using asynchronous programming, we can perform multiple tasks at the same time; this way, we can let the UI load while a function continues to execute.
