# Web Development
Notes about full-stack web development, ranging from noters about topics and concepts to small cheatsheets for commands, utilities, and keywords. Different development technologies are discussed in separate pages.

## Basics
Things to know before starting to develop for the Web, ranging from how to use the Linux terminal, how to design your code, and overviews of important technology.

### Terminal Usage
- [Basic Terminal Commands](basics/terminal/terminal.md)
- [Git](basics/terminal/git.md)
- [SSH](basics/terminal/ssh.md)

### Design Principles
- [SOLID](basics/design/solid.md)
- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid
- YAGNI - You aren't gonna need it
- DRY - Don't repeat yourself

### Development Technology
- [HTTP/HTTPS](basics/technology/http.md)
- [APIs](basics/technology/api.md)
- [SPA versus MPA](basics/technology/spavmpa.md)

## Frontend
User interfaces and experiences. The frontend revolves around three core elements: HTML for form, CSS for style, and Javascript for function. With the rise of client-side frameworks and SPAs, the Javascript ecosystem has grown extensively and has a lot to offer.

### HTML

Progressive Web Apps

Typescript

Server side rendering

GatsbyJS

Electron

React Native

## Backend
Server side code can be written in pretty much any language, but popular choices are scripting languages. Often, a backend will be based around a framework to make the project more structured and easier to handle. In addition to a programming language, the backend uses databases and web servers.

### Scripting Languages and Frameworks
Node.js
- Express
- Koa

Python
- Django
- Flask

Ruby
- Rails

PHP
- Laravel

Java
- Spring

### Other Languages
Haskell

Clojure

Go

Rust

### Databases
SQL Databases
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- PostgreSQL

NoSQL
- MongoDB

### Backend Concepts
Caching
- Memcached
- Redis

RESTful APIs

Authentication
- OAUth
- Basic authentication
- Token
- JWT
- OpenID

Message Brokers
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka

ElasticSearch

Docker

Web Servers
- Apache
- nginx
- Node.js

Web Sockets

GraphQL

SOAP

## Devops
Even farther in the backend than the backend, borderline sysadmin.

Make sure you are proficient in a programming language like Python, C++, Node.js, etc.

### OS Concepts

### Advanced Linux
Linux OS

Bash scripting

Vim

Text manipulation

Compiling from source

Process Monitoring

System Performance

Network

Other stuff

### Networking and Security

### Setup
Reverse proxy

Forward proxy

Caching server

Load balancer

Firewall

Web server
- Apache
- nginx

### Basically Sysadmin
Containers

Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes
- Docker swarm

Terraform

CI/CD
- Jenkins
- GitLab

Log Management
