# APIs
API stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface and refers to a set of tools that can be used to create complex functionality more easily. An API offers simpler syntax that abstracts away a lot of the complicated code that most developers don't need to know.

Browser APIs are built into the Web browser and allow us to implement functionality like DOM manipulation and AJAX requests more easily. Third-party APIs are developed by other companies and usually have to be added to a project, and they allow us to include functionality from other platforms.

An API is related to a library, which includes functions that implement the API. The next step up is a framework, which is a package of related APIs, libraries, and technologies which work together to take control of the code.
