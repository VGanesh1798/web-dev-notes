# SOLID Design Principle
SOLID is a mnemonic acronym in OOP for software design principles.

## Single Responsibility
Each class should only have a single responsibility.

## Open-Closed
A software entity should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution
Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation
Split the desired functionality into pieces that are fully used.

## Dependency Inversion
Use interfaces instead of implementations whenever possible.
